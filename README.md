## 📌 Overview

This repository is a hands-on penetration testing portfolio covering end-to-end attack chains against intentionally vulnerable VulnHub machines. Each walkthrough follows a structured methodology — from initial reconnaissance and enumeration through exploitation, privilege escalation, and professional reporting — mirroring real-world penetration testing engagements.

**Who this is for:** Ethical hackers, OSCP candidates, CTF players, security analysts, bug bounty hunters, red team practitioners, and cybersecurity students looking for practical, documented offensive security techniques.

## 🔍 Methodology Phases

Each machine walkthrough follows the industry-standard penetration testing lifecycle:

### Phase 1 — Reconnaissance & Enumeration

Active and passive information gathering to map the attack surface.

- Network discovery and host identification with **Netdiscover** and **Nmap**
- Full port scanning with service version detection and OS fingerprinting
- Directory and file enumeration using **Gobuster** and **Dirbuster**
- Subdomain enumeration and DNS reconnaissance
- Web application fingerprinting and technology stack identification
- OSINT and metadata analysis

### Phase 2 — Web Application Security Testing

Assessment aligned with the **OWASP Top 10** and beyond.

| Vulnerability Class | Techniques Covered |
|---|---|
| Injection | SQL Injection (SQLi), Command Injection |
| XSS | Reflected, Stored, DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting |
| File Handling | Unrestricted File Upload, Directory Traversal, Path Traversal |
| Access Control | Authentication Bypass, IDOR, Broken Authorization |
| File Inclusion | Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI) |
| Configuration | Security Misconfigurations, Default Credentials, Exposed Endpoints |

### Phase 3 — Exploitation & Initial Access

Turning identified vulnerabilities into verified, reproducible access.

- Manual and **Metasploit Framework**-assisted exploitation
- Reverse shell generation and payload deployment (bash, Python, PHP, netcat)
- Credential attacks with **Hydra** and **John the Ripper**
- **SQLMap** for automated SQL injection exploitation
- **Burp Suite** for web application interception and manipulation
- Custom exploit adaptation for version-specific vulnerabilities

### Phase 4 — Privilege Escalation

Systematic escalation from low-privilege shell to root/SYSTEM.

- SUID/SGID binary abuse and GTFOBins exploitation
- Cron job hijacking and writable script injection
- Weak file permissions on sensitive configuration files
- Kernel vulnerability identification and safe exploitation
- Sudo misconfigurations and policy bypass
- Credential harvesting from config files, history, and environment variables
- Lateral movement fundamentals and pivoting concepts

### Phase 5 — Post-Exploitation & Reporting

Structured documentation following professional pentesting standards.

- Proof of Concept (PoC) documentation with step-by-step reproduction
- Screenshot evidence and command output capture
- Vulnerability impact analysis (CIA triad)
- CVSS scoring and risk prioritization
- Remediation recommendations and developer-friendly fixes
- Professional penetration testing report templates
